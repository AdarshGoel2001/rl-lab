## Achievements

**Nov 11:** Started World Models, read paper, created boilerplate
**Nov 12:** Implemented collect step, started ConvVAE
**Nov 13:** [NO LOG SUBMITTED - UNACCOUNTED DAY]
**Nov 14:** Decision point - chose to attempt full implementation (VAE + MDN-RNN + Controller) instead of cutting scope. High risk of shipping nothing.

- None yet

**Quality Metrics:**
- Models implemented: 0/15

- Results reproduced: 0/15

**CRITICAL STATUS:**
- 3.5 days until World Models deadline
