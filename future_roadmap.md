Long-Term Roadmap: From PPO Student to World Model Researcher

  Phase 1: Model-Free Foundations (Weeks 1-4)

  Goal: Master policy gradient methods and value-based learning

  1.1 Policy Gradient Family

  - PPO (your current homework) → CartPole, then Atari Pong
  - A2C → Compare synchronous vs PPO's clipped updates
  - REINFORCE → Pure policy gradient baseline
  - PPO-Continuous → DMControl Cheetah (continuous actions)
  - PPO-KL-Penalty

  1.2 Value-Based Methods

  - DQN → Atari Breakout
  - Double DQN → Fix overestimation bias
  - Rainbow DQN → Full feature suite
  - SAC → Continuous control baseline for DMControl

  1.3 Environment Progression

  - CartPole/LunarLander → Discrete control basics
  - DMControl Suite → Continuous control (Cheetah, Walker, Reacher)
  - Atari → Pixel observations (Pong, Breakout, Montezuma's Revenge)
  - Procgen → Generalization testing (CoinRun, Maze)

  Phase 2: Advanced Model-Free (Weeks 5-8)

  Goal: Master exploration, multi-agent, and advanced techniques

  2.1 Exploration Methods

  - PPO + ICM (Intrinsic Curiosity) → Montezuma's Revenge

  - Exploration Module System (curiosity, count-based, noise)
  - Distributed Training Framework

  Phase 3: World Models & Planning (Weeks 9-16)

  Goal: Transition from model-free to model-based mastery

  3.1 Classic World Models

  - Dyna-Q → Simple planning with learned model
  - MuZero → Learn dynamics through tree search
  - PlaNet → Latent dynamics for continuous control

  3.2 Modern World Models

  - Dreamer v2 → Discrete latent representations
  - Dreamer v3 → Your main world model implementation

  3.3 Next-Gen Architectures

  - SSM/Mamba Dynamics → Replace RSSM with state space models
  - Transformer World Models → Attention-based dynamics
  - V-JEPA + Action Heads → Frozen vision encoder + learned control

  3.4 Test Environments

  - Crafter → Long-horizon survival world
  - MiniHack → Symbolic reasoning + memory

  - Multi-modal Fusion → Vision + proprioception

  Phase 5: Advanced Topics (Weeks 21-24)

  Goal: Cutting-edge research directions

  5.1 Generative World Models

  5.2 Long-Context & Memory

  - Transformer-XL for RL → Long-term memory
  - Mamba for Sequences → Efficient long context
  - Memory-Augmented Networks → External memory systems

  Homework Files Feasibility Analysis

  ✅ Can Create Homework Templates For:
  - All Policy Gradient Methods (PPO, A2C, REINFORCE, SAC)
  - Value Methods (DQN family, Rainbow)
  - Basic World Models (Dreamer v1-v3, PlaNet)
  - Exploration Methods (ICM, RND curiosity modules)

  ⚠️ Partial Templates (Need External Pretrained Models):
  - V-JEPA → Can create action head homework, need pretrained encoder
  - DINOv2 Integration → Can create adapter homework
  - MAE for Control → Can create fine-tuning homework

  ❌ Too Complex for Homework Format:
  - MuZero → Tree search is very complex
  - Genie Models → Cutting-edge, rapidly evolving
  - Full Transformer Training → Requires massive compute
