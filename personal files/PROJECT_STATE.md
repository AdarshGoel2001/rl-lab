# RL MASTERY JOURNEY - PROJECT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
Last Updated: Sept 3, 2025 | Phase A→B Transition | Energy: High | Velocity: 4x

## EXECUTIVE OBJECTIVES

### Long-term Vision (24 weeks)
PPO student → World model researcher → Research contributor
- Week 9: First world model (Dreamer v1) 
- Week 17: Vision intelligence (V-JEPA integration)
- Week 24: Novel research contributions ready

### Short-term Focus (Next 7 days)
Phase A completion: MiniGrid mastery + hyperparameter optimization system
Phase B preparation: Atari pipeline setup, pixel control foundations

## PERSONAL PROFILE & PREFERENCES

### Working Style Insights
- **Velocity over perfection**: Strategic advance decisions (Pendulum -300→continue)
- **Framework-first thinking**: Strong system design before algorithm specifics
- **Implementation speed**: 4x faster than typical due to programming foundation
- **ADHD optimization**: Burst learning sessions, clear milestone targeting
- **Energy management**: High=complex implementation, Medium=systematic work, Low=documentation

### Effective Patterns
- Clear "done-when" criteria prevent endless optimization
- Resume/checkpoint systems essential for long projects  
- Compound progress through solid infrastructure
- Direct path from concept to working code

### Ineffective Patterns
- Over-optimization on single environments
- Theory without implementation practice
- Database-heavy project management (prefer living documents)

## TIME ESTIMATION & CALIBRATION

### Prediction Accuracy Tracking
Original Phase A estimate: 4 weeks
Actual performance: 1 week (75% complete)
Calibration factor: 0.25x (you work 4x faster than standard estimates)

### Completed Task Times
- Acrobot mastery: <1 day (estimated 3-4 days)
- Pendulum framework: <1 day (estimated 2-3 days)  
- Basic infrastructure: 1 day (estimated 1 week)
- **MiniGrid 5x5 DoorKey: MINUTES (estimated 1-2 days)** - 4x velocity confirmed on complex visual RL

### Updated Predictions (calibrated) - Start Time Tracking Sept 3, 2025
- **Transfer learning (5x5→8x8): HOURS** (was 1-2 days) - **START TIME: Sept 3, 2025**
- **Hyperparameter sweep system: <1 DAY** (was 2-3 days) - Expected completion: Sept 4
- **Parallel environments: <1 DAY** (was 2-3 days) - Expected completion: Sept 5
- Atari Pong mastery: 1-2 days (was 1 week)
- World model implementation: 3-4 days (was 1 week)

## DEADLINE MANAGEMENT

### Active Deadlines - DRAMATICALLY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE
- ~~MiniGrid DoorKey: Sept 10~~ **COMPLETED SEPT 3** (7 days early)
- Transfer learning + Hyperparameter sweep: Sept 4-5 (7-8 days early)
- Phase A completion: **Sept 6** (9 days ahead of Sept 15 target)

### Milestone Calendar
Sept 15: Phase A→B transition review
Oct 1: Atari mastery checkpoint
Oct 15: Advanced model-free methods complete
Nov 1: WORLD MODEL MILESTONE (first imagination-based agent)
Dec 1: Modern architecture integration
Jan 1: Vision intelligence systems
Jan 31: Research contribution readiness

## ACHIEVEMENT HISTORY

### Completed (Sept 2-3)
- Acrobot-v1: Stable learning curves, variance <20%
- Pendulum-v1: Continuous control framework operational  
- Infrastructure: Resume, logging, evaluation systems proven
- Strategic decision: Velocity over perfection paradigm established
- **MiniGrid 5x5 DoorKey: BREAKTHROUGH MILESTONE** (Sept 3) - CNN architecture + sparse rewards mastered
  - **COMPLETION TIME: MINUTES** - fastest complex RL implementation yet
  - Full implementation by Claude Code with educational explanations
  - Discrete action space + visual observation pipeline proven
  - Foundation for advanced environment complexity established
  - **Velocity validation: 4x+ confirmed on visual RL environments**

### Next Phase Targets (In Progress - Sept 3)
- **Transfer learning: 5x5→8x8 MiniGrid environments** - ⏱️ **STARTED SEPT 3** - Expected completion: HOURS
- **Hyperparameter sweep system: Multi-experiment orchestration** - Expected start: Sept 3 evening
- **Parallel environments: Scalable data collection infrastructure** - Expected start: Sept 4

## CURRENT STATUS & NEXT ACTIONS

### Active Sprint (Week 1-2) - **ACCELERATED COMPLETION**
Progress: **95% complete** (massively ahead of 4-week timeline)
~~Priority 1: MiniGrid DoorKey 95% success rate~~ **✅ COMPLETED SEPT 3**
**Current Priority: Transfer learning (5x5→8x8)** - ⏱️ Time tracking active
Next Priority: Hyperparameter sweep framework operational
Stretch Goal: Phase A completion by Sept 6 (9 days early)

### Risk Factors
- None identified at current velocity
- Complexity scaling risk at Week 9 (world models) - prepare scaffolding
- Integration complexity at Week 17 (vision systems)

### Energy-Matched Task Queue  
HIGH: Transfer learning experiments (5x5→8x8), parallel environment architecture
MEDIUM: Hyperparameter sweep orchestration, statistical comparison pipelines
LOW: Documentation consolidation, advanced planning, experiment cleanup

## STRATEGIC INSIGHTS

### Performance Multipliers Identified
- Strong programming foundation eliminates implementation bottlenecks
- Framework-first approach enables compound algorithm development
- Clear milestone definitions prevent scope creep
- ADHD hyperfocus sessions create burst progress patterns

### Adaptation Strategy
- Maintain 4x velocity assumption for near-term planning
- Prepare complexity scaffolding 2 weeks before major architecture changes
- Preserve strategic advance philosophy (done > perfect)
- Leverage energy state optimization for task scheduling

### Success Pattern Reinforcement
- Continue "done-when" criteria for all milestones
- Maintain infrastructure investment for long-term velocity
- Preserve momentum through strategic completion decisions
- Document insights for pattern recognition improvement
