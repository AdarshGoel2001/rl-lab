awesome—think of this as teaching your PPO to (1) ride a tricycle, (2) a bicycle, then (3) a motorbike with a helmet. Each step adds a new kind of “balance” (discrete vs continuous control, exploration, pixels, generalization). I’ll give you the path, why each step matters, and “done-when” gates so you know you’ve truly leveled up.

# Phase A — Three quick classics on your Mac (build breadth fast)

**Goal:** one discrete, one continuous, one gridworld—all with one runner & one config style.

1. **Discrete:** Acrobot-v1
   Why: Unlike CartPole, rewards are sparse-ish and unstable around the goal; stresses advantage estimates & entropy.
   Config nudges: `GAE λ=0.95, γ=0.99, clip=0.2, ent_coef≈0.01, epochs=10, minibatch=64, batch=2k–8k`.
   Done-when: Median return consistently beats baseline (≥−100) across 3 seeds; variance <20%.

2. **Continuous:** Pendulum-v1
   Why: Tests action squashing, value scale, and reward normalization in continuous spaces.
   Add: action scaling wrapper; reward normalization; value-loss clipping.
   Done-when: Avg episode reward ≥ −200 with 3 seeds; stable entropy decay; expl. variance ≥0.8.

3. **Gridworld:** MiniGrid DoorKey-5x5 (or 8x8)
   Why: Partial observability + exploration. Teaches you to add observation wrappers & curriculum sizing.
   Add: one-hot encoding or simple CNN for 7×7 egocentric view; frame-stack 4; sticky-action=False.
   Done-when: ≥95% success on 5x5; 8x8 reaches >70% within your step budget.

**Reasoning:** These three expose PPO to (i) discrete instability, (ii) continuous scaling, (iii) exploration + partial observability—without heavy compute. Your Mac can handle all three quickly with vectorized envs (8–16 envs) and `torch.set_default_dtype(torch.float32)`. If you’re on Apple Silicon, enable MPS; otherwise stick to CPU and fewer envs.

# Phase B — Harder ladder for PPO (toward its frontier)

We climb from “easy pixels” to “where PPO starts to struggle,” so you’ll see limits clearly.

1. **PongNoFrameskip-v4 (Atari)**
   Why: Classic pixel control; PPO succeeds with standard preprocessing.
   Preproc: grayscale → resize 84×84 → frame-stack 4; sticky-actions; max-no-op starts; reward clipping to ±1.
   CNN: Nature-CNN or IMPALA-small; value head shares trunk.
   Budget: \~10–20M frames for textbook curves; you can still see learning earlier.
   Done-when: Beats −5 → +15 trajectory on learning curve and stabilizes across 3 seeds.

2. **BreakoutNoFrameskip-v4**
   Why: Slightly trickier credit assignment; tests KL/entropy schedules.
   Tip: Try linear entropy decay; tune `clip=0.1–0.3` sweep.
   Done-when: Reaches 100+ average score (seeded).

3. **Procgen (CoinRun → StarPilot)**
   Why: Generalization across levels; PPO is a standard baseline here.
   Setup: train on 200 levels, test on ∞; IMPALA-small + batch norm; no reward clipping.
   Done-when: Clear train→test generalization gap measured & reduced via tiny augments (random shift).

4. **(Optional) DMControl pixels: Cartpole-swingup or Cheetah-run**
   Why: Continuous control with pixels—where PPO is far from SOTA. Good failure case before SAC/DrQv2.
   Done-when: You replicate a modest baseline and document where PPO falls short (sample-efficiency).

**Reasoning:** Pong → Breakout teaches the pixel stack; Procgen reveals generalization; DMControl shows PPO’s limits on pixel+continuous—setting up why SAC+DrQ rules there.

# Phase C — Hyperparameter experiment suites (before moving on)

You’ll get a small, honest search that finds robust configs per environment class.

**Harness:**

* `sweep.py --algo ppo --env <env> --space configs/ppo_space.yaml --n-trials 30 --seeds 3`
* Each trial logs: final return, AUC of learning curve, time-to-score, clipfrac, approx\_KL, entropy trajectory.
* Aggregator outputs `summary.json` (mean±std), best config, and sensitivity plots.

**Spaces (good, Mac-friendly ranges):**

* LR: {1e-3, 5e-4, 3e-4, 1e-4}
* Clip: {0.1, 0.2, 0.3}
* GAE λ: {0.9, 0.95, 0.97}
* γ: {0.99, 0.995 (Atari/Procgen)}
* Entropy coef: {0.0, 0.005, 0.01}
* Epochs: {5, 10}
* Batch per update: {2048, 4096, 8192} (classics) / {64k, 128k} (Atari/Procgen with many envs)
* Minibatch: {64, 128, 256}
* KL target (early stop or adaptive clip): {None, 0.01, 0.02}

**Done-when:** For each env class (classic, Atari, Procgen), you publish a “What actually matters” note with 3–5 bullets + one plot (e.g., clip and LR dominate in Pong; entropy schedule matters in Breakout; batch size dominates in Procgen).

**Reasoning:** You’ll learn which knobs actually move learning in each domain. This also locks your evaluator + leaderboard credibility.

# Phase D — Baseline algos to compare (one “frontier” each)

You want one strong DQN and one strong SAC so your PPO results have context.

1. **Frontier DQN: Rainbow (full or “Lite”)**

* **Full**: Double Q, Dueling, PER, NoisyNets, N-step (n=3), Distributional C51.
* **Lite**: everything but C51 (easier to code); still very strong.
* Use same Atari preprocessing; target update every 2k–10k steps; PER α=0.5, β annealed to 1.0.
* Done-when: Beats your PPO Pong/Breakout scores in equal or less wall-clock on Mac (single env, replay).

2. **Frontier SAC: SAC-DrQ-v2 for pixels (and vanilla SAC for states)**

* Vanilla SAC: automatic entropy tuning, twin Q, target smoothing; test on Pendulum, MtnCarCont.
* DrQ-v2: random shift/crop augment on pixels; shared encoder with Q/π; stop-grad trick from critics to actor.
* Done-when: On DMControl pixel Cartpole-swingup / Cheetah-run, SAC-DrQv2 sample-efficiency > PPO by a clear margin.

**Reasoning:** Rainbow is near-SOTA on Atari without insane tricks; SAC-DrQv2 defines modern pixel control for continuous tasks. With these, your repo becomes a credible lab, not a one-algo toy.

# Phase E — Give algorithms “sight” (encoders & interfaces)

Unify how vision plugs into every algo so you can swap backbones later.

**Encoder interface**

```python
class Encoder(nn.Module):
    def forward(self, obs): ...  # (B,C,H,W) -> (B,D)
    @property
    def out_dim(self): ...
```

* **Backbones to include:**

  * Nature-CNN (fast, simple)
  * IMPALA-small (better inductive bias for Procgen/Atari)
  * ResNet-18-tiny (for future pretraining; can freeze or finetune)
* **Tricks:** channel-last tensor format for MPS; normalize to \[0,1]; frame-stack; optional grayscale for Atari.

**Where to train encoders:**

* PPO/DQN: usually joint training from scratch is fine on Atari/Procgen.
* SAC-pixels: adopt DrQv2 (augmentations + shared encoder) to stabilize.
* (Later) Pretrained options: R3M/VC-1/DINOv2 for robotics-style visuals—keep interface ready but don’t block on them.

**Done-when:** A single flag `encoder=impala_small` switches all algos; you can freeze or finetune via config.

**Reasoning:** Vision is a pluggable sense, not hard-coded per algo. This lets you climb toward world models later without refactors.

# Phase F — Visual games to prove it works

Choose a compact but telling suite:

* **Atari:** Pong, Breakout, SpaceInvaders (shows overfitting/instability), Seaquest (credit assignment).
* **Procgen:** CoinRun (gen), StarPilot (harder).
* **DMControl pixels:** Cartpole-swingup, Cheetah-run.
* **CarRacing-v2:** great for SAC with pixels; optional sticky-actions off.

**Done-when:** For each family, you have (i) best algo per game, (ii) a curve, (iii) a short note “why X wins here.”

**Reasoning:** This covers discrete/continuous + deterministic/stochastic + generalization—enough variety to spark new ideas later.

---

# Phase G — Packaging, sweeps, and your “proof of work” release

* **Evaluator:** `eval.py --algo <ppo|rainbow|sac> --env <...> --seeds 3 --steps <N>` → writes `runs/<...>/summary.json`.
* **Leaderboard:** static HTML (or README table) that reads JSON; shows mean±CI, wall-clock, commit hash.
* **Sweeps:** `sweeps/<algo>_<env>.yaml` with spaces above; export “winners.yaml” for default configs.
* **Bloglet:** “What actually matters in PPO/DQN/SAC for \[classics/Atari/Procgen] on a Mac.”

**Done-when:** A stranger can reproduce within 5–10% using your defaults.

## Day-by-day (7–10 days, realistic on a Mac)

**Day 1–2:** Acrobot, Pendulum, DoorKey; unify wrappers; “Done-when” gates pass.
**Day 3:** Atari pipeline (wrappers, Nature/IMPALA CNN), run Pong; start Breakout.
**Day 4:** Procgen CoinRun; tune batch & entropy; log generalization metrics.
**Day 5:** PPO sweeps (CartPole, Acrobot, Pong) with 20–30 trials; write findings.
**Day 6–7:** Rainbow-DQN (Lite or Full); beat PPO on Pong/Breakout.
**Day 8:** SAC (states) → Pendulum/MtnCarCont; then SAC-DrQv2 for Cartpole-swingup pixels.
**Day 9:** Encoder interface (IMPALA/Nature/ResNet-tiny); flag to freeze/finetune; rerun key games.
**Day 10:** Leaderboard + README + mini blog; tag v0.1.

## What I can generate next (your pick)

1. tiny **`envs.yaml`** set for Acrobot, Pendulum, DoorKey, Pong, Breakout, CoinRun (with sensible defaults).
2. a **`sweep.py`** skeleton + `ppo_space.yaml` ready to run.
3. **Rainbow-DQN “Lite”** file skeletons (PER, dueling, double, n-step, noisy) you just fill in.
4. **SAC-DrQv2** training loop scaffold with the augment + shared-encoder bits.

Which chunk do you want me to open first—**(1) env configs**, **(2) sweeps scaffolding**, **(3) Rainbow-DQN**, or **(4) SAC-DrQv2**?
